# Netherlands School-Vacation with HomeAssistant Sensor Custom Component
## Get Netherlands School Vacation in HomeAssistant // mAiden

This sensor checks whether today is a day off from school or not.
The sensor is divided into two types, elementary school and high school.
In Israel, the vacation begins on 22.06 in high school, while in elementary school the vacation begins on 01.07. 
Therefore there is a separation that allows the creation of separate automations for a school type.

It's very useful if you set a input_bolean in HA cause you can make automation that set if is vacation or not..
example :
```python
- id: Set_School_Mode_Off
  alias: Set School Mode Off
  trigger: 
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.school_is_elementary_vacation
    to: 'True'
  condition: []
  action:
  - data:
      entity_id: input_boolean.school_auto
    service: input_boolean.turn_off
 ```
 ## Guide How to use it
